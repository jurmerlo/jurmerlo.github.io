I'm JuriÃ«n, a senior software engineer with over 8 years of experience, currently living in Ireland. I primarily work with TypeScript and Python during the day.

In my spare time, I enjoy game development. I started with [Unity](https://unity.com) and explored many other game engines, including [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com), [Godot](https://godotengine.org), [Monogame](https://monogame.net), [Defold](https://defold.com), and [Love2d](https://love2d.org), before eventually deciding to build my own. I love learning new things, and creating a game engine felt like the natural next step.  
Over the years, I've built a few small games and several small game engines. While most of them remain unfinished, I learned a lot in the process.  

I do have a few smaller games on my [itch.io page](https://jurmerlo.itch.io), as well as one in the App Store called [Gravity Golfing](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gravity-golfing/id1498685589). It is not available in all countries at the moment, but you can play the web version on [itch.io](https://jurmerlo.itch.io/gravitygolfing). All of these games were made in custom engines.

I enjoy exploring new technologies and techniques. I love the challenge of creating something from scratch and seeing it come to life.

Currently, I'm working on a 2D game engine in TypeScript called [Lunas](/projects/lunas).
