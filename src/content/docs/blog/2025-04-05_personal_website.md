It's time for a new iteration of my website. I want to showcase some of the projects I've been working on and start writing a blog again.  
This time, I'm planning to create a small 2D game engine. I want to document how everything works and share my progress along the way.

For this iteration, I'm using [Astro](https://astro.build) to build the site, along with the [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) template.  
Starlight is designed for documentation but there is a [blog plugin](https://starlight-blog-docs.vercel.app). I don't want to spend too much time on the site's design, and the Starlight template has everything I need out of the box. I can use the documentation section for my project showcase and have a separate blog section for updates.

My plan is to post here regularly as I work on my projects and learn new things.
